  	<h2>Why a Service Fee?</h2>
    <p>To enable our members to buy and sell songs for as little as a quarter; we must impose a small service fee for Credit Card purchases under $1. But remember, if you pay using your funds in your bopaBank - there is never a service fee! </p>
    
      <p>And if you don’t have enough money in your bopaBank – just buy a few more songs - so your total is above $1 and there is NO service fee. </p>
