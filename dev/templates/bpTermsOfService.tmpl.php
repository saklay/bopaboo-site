                          <h3>Disputes</h3>
                          If there is a dispute between users or between users and any third  party, You understand and agree that bopaboo is under no obligation to  become involved. In the event that you have such a dispute, you hereby  release bopaboo, its officers, employees, agents and successors in  rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of  every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected,  disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such  disputes and/or our service. If you are a California resident, you  waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says &quot;A general release  does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect  to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if  known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the  debtor.&quot;</li>

                            <li>General.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and bopaboo  and governs your use of the Site or Service, superseding any prior  agreements between You and bopaboo. This Agreement will be governed by  the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its  conflict of laws provisions. Any claim or controversy in any way  arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use will be filed in a  court of competent jurisdiction sitting in Fairfax County, Virginia.  Both parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction in that county. The  failure of bopaboo to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the  Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If  any provision of the Agreement is found by a court of competent  jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the  court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as  reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement  remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any  statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising  out of or related to use of the Site or Service or the Agreement must  be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose  or be forever barred.</li>
