						    <ul>
                              <li><strong>User Provided Information</strong>:  For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard  technical information, such as your IP address.

						    <p>The  information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is  used to provide our services to you. For example, even as we endeavor  to protect your identity, we may use your demographic information to  create a database of user profiles, select advertisements based on your  information and for marketing analysis.

                            <h2>How bopaboo Protects Information</h2>
						    <p>bopaboo's  computers store user account information, and may cache user profile  information for backup purposes. bopaboo employs the following industry  standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration  of the information under our control:</p>
						    <ul>
                              <li>Use of secure connections using SSL to safeguard information when transmitted from your Web browser to the bopaboo service. </li>
						      <li>Use of security controls to restrict access to databases housing personally identifying information.</li>
						      <li>Use of encryption for sensitive personal  information, such as email addresses and user names.</li>
						      <li>Restrict  employee access to databases containing personal information and impose  confidentiality requirements upon employees who do.</li>
						      <li>Bind subcontractors with contractual, technical and       organizational measures to protect your personal information.</li>
					        </ul>
					    </div>
						  <div>
                            <h2>When bopaboo Discloses Information</h2>
						    <p>We  may share personally identifiable information about our users with  third parties, including: (1) with your consent or following the  opportunity to opt-in or opt-out for specific programs or features, or  (2) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary pursuant to a  subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; (3) to process  payments for products or services; (4) as otherwise stated in this  Privacy Policy; (5) where required by law; or (6) at our sole  discretion, where we deem necessary to respond to claims, to protect  the safety of any individual or the public, or to protect the rights,  property or personal safety of bopaboo or any third party. We also  share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous Log  File information) with interested third-parties to assist them in  understanding the usage patterns for our service.</p>
						    <p>In  the event of a change of ownership or a direct merger with or  acquisition by another entity, your information may be transferred to  the acquiring entity. You have the ability and control to remove or  alter your account specific information at any time.</p>
					    </div>
						  <div>
                            <h2>Third Parties/Advertisers and Your Information</h2>
						    <p>bopaboo  may provide links to third party websites or allow other companies,  called third-party ad servers, to display advertisements to users. Ad  server companies can write and read their own cookies on your computer,  just as if you had requested a web page from their website. bopaboo is  not responsible for, and does not have any control over, the privacy  practices or the content of such third parties. </p>
						    <p>Please  note that information stored or cached on other users' computers is  subject to those users' security practices, which are beyond bopaboo's  control. Although we make good faith efforts to store information  collected or stored by bopaboo in a secure manner, we cannot guarantee  complete security. Information held by bopaboo will be maintained for a  length of time appropriate to our business needs.</p>
					    </div>
						  <div>
                            <h2>User Options and Responsibilities</h2>
						    <p>Your  user profile contains information about you that you may want to share  with others. Protecting the privacy of your profile is your  responsibility. We caution you not to share sensitive information (such  as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or driver's license  numbers) with other users whom you do not know or place such  information in your profile.</p>
						    <p>Any  information you choose to display on bopaboo.com, including your  profile, will be viewable by the entire Web (i.e., everyone). For your  own safety we caution you not to include home addresses, telephone  numbers or any other personal information that could allow strangers to  contact you outside of the bopaboo service.</p>
						    <p>To  maintain privacy it is also important not to share your password with  anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and  symbols makes it more difficult for others to guess your password. It  is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis.</p>
						    <p>Identity  theft is a serious concern to all of us. To help protect yourself  against identity theft, please remember that bopaboo will NEVER ask for  your password in either a non-secure or unsolicited email communication</p>
						    <p>You  may choose to correct or update the information you have submitted to  us by editing your profile or account information. If you remove your  information, it may continue to persist on back-up media.</p>
